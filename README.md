The project operates on the basis of the client server architecture. In the game can participate from 1 to 6 players. Each player, using the client application, can connect to server and join the game. The server verifies the correctness of movements and mediates in communication. Bots-players controlled by the server can also be added to the game.

I created this project with my friend as an university project. I was responsible for client-server communication, logic of movements and some GUI functions.
